Doormat Code



This code is for the arduino connected to the doormat--it sends a '1' to the buzzer, which is used to indicate
that the guest has arrived, and the buzzer should stop timing. This code is based off of a sample code to test buttons 
and xbee communication.*/

// constants won't change. They're used here to 
// set pin numbers:
const int buttonPin = 2;     // the number of the pushbutton pin
const int ledPin =  13;      // the number of the LED pin
SoftwareSerial xbeeSerial(8, 9); // RX, TX

// variables will change:
int buttonState = 0;         // variable for reading the pushbutton status
int lastButtonState = 0;

void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);      
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);     
  // begin the serial connection with xbee
  xbeeSerial.begin(19200);
  Serial.begin(57600);
}

void loop(){
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // check if the pushbutton is pressed.
  // if it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
  if (buttonState != lastButtonState) {     
    // turn LED on:    
    if (buttonState == HIGH) {
      //for debugging purposes; to make sure button is being acknowledged
      //also for external large button that has built in LED, this will turn that LED on
      digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);  
      // send to xbee serial connection
      xbeeSerial.print('1');
